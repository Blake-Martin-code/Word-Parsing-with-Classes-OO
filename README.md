# Word-Parsing-with-Classes-OO
This program implements object oriented coding with classes to parse a string, or possibly a file with further implementation (not hard) to create objects of words

download the test.cc Words.cc Words.h and the makelist to get started
in your terminal execute cmake . && make to compile and create the object file
then run ./test or ./hw3

output should be similar too

There are 9 words.
0: “n”
1: “=”
2: “a” (escaped)
3: “+=” (escaped)
4: “(”
5: “b+14226034”
6: “)”
7: “#”
8: “😈”
n,=,a,+=,(,b+14226034,),#,😈
